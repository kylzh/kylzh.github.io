        <h1>🧐 A little bit about <span style="color: #ff86ba">me</span>.</h1>

     <p>I'm <span style="color: #ff86ba">Kayla Zhu (朱泳茹)</span>, a Vancouver-based journalist and content writer interested in all things data journalism.
        <br><br>I grew up in East Vancouver before hopping over to Toronto to study journalism at
        <span style="color: #ff86ba">Toronto Metropolitan University</span> (and do a minor in visual communication, a.k.a graphic design).

        <br><br>I quickly fell in love with <span style="color: #ff86ba">data journalism</span> – everything from scraping websites
        to analyzing a huge spreadsheet to creating easy-to-understand, accessible data visualizations 
        and maps. Anything involving telling compelling stories or explaining complicated
        concepts with data, I'm game.
        <br><br>
        Beyond data journalism, I've worked in a range of journalism/editorial roles as well as 
        communications roles and have significant experience in multimedia, cross-platform communication
        using social media, email copy, graphic design and content writing. You can check out my
        work history on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kayla-zhu-730194149/">LinkedIn</a>.
        <br><br>
        💻  I'm open to freelance writing, design or data analysis/visualization assignments (or a combination of 
        any of those things). Feel free to shoot me an email at 
        <span style="color: #ff86ba">kayla.yr.zhu@gmail.com</span> if you're interested in working with me or want to
        chat about some of my <a href="writing.html">previous work!
            <br><br>
        </a>

        <h2>🐰 And little bit more about me.</h2>
        <p>In my free time, you can find me playing lots of ultimate frisbee 🥏, 
            hiking and exploring B.C's forests 🌲, reading every single Letterboxd review of the latest indie movies 📽️, finding yuzu-flavored 
            things to eat 🍊, creating highly-specific Spotify playlists 🎧, or casually gaming 🕹️.
            <br><br>
            I love reading and learning about urban planning (especially transit systems), 
            social impact startups, and various social issues.
