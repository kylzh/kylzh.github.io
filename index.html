        <h2>🏡 Geographic data-driven feature on short-term rental licencing in Canada</h2>
        <div class="container-for-projects">
            <div class="column">
                <h3><a href="https://theijf.org/half-of-airbnbs-in-major-canadian-cities-appear-to-be-operating-without-a-licence" target="_blank" class="project-links">Half of Airbnbs in major Canadian cities appear to be operating without a licence
                </a></h3>

            <div class="column">
                <p class="item">
                For this story, I calculated the approximate licencing rate of Airbnbs across nine major Canadian cities by 
                creating a custom dataset that includes the number of Airbnb listings and the number of active short-term rental 
                licences in each city. 
                <br><br>
                I wrote about the various short-term rental regulations in each city, the impact of the proliferation of the 
                short-term rental industry on the long-term rental market, what's working and what's not working in regards 
                to regulation, and spoke to experts about how platforms and governments can work together together to ensure 
                higher licencing rates.
                <br><br>
                I liaised with city and provincial staff to acquire up-to-date short-term rental licencing data for each city – including sending
                ATIP requests – and worked with non-profit advocacy group InsideAirbnb to acquire Canada-wide listings data for Airbnb.
                I used Python to clean the listings and licencing data, and then used spreadsheets and QGIS to analyze the data.

                        For the CVCA, I analyzed Canadian and international venture debt deals data using Google Sheets.
                         Charts were created using Flourish. Venture debt data came from CVCA's proprietary deals database 
                         as well as Pitchbook data.
                         <br><br>
                        In this story, I compared the rising trend of venture debt deals in Canada with international trends, spoke to venture capital leaders to identify the motivations behind the rising trends,
                        summarized key insights from the analysis and visualized the venture debt deals data
                          with interactive data visualizations.
